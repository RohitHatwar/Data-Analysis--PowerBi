# HR Summary Report - Power BI Project

## Project's Overview
This project is a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard created using Power BI Desktop. 
It is designed to analyze workforce data, provide insights into employee behavior, and support HR and business leaders in making strategic, data-driven decisions.
The project uses a cleaned .csv dataset containing employee details and HR-related metrics. With this data, we‚Äôve developed multiple dashboards focusing on areas such as attrition, performance, department-wise statistics, and demographics.
The dashboard serves as a prototype solution for HR teams looking to identify trends, manage workforce planning, and mitigate attrition risks.

## Project Objectives
* Identify key HR performance indicators (KPIs)

* Monitor employee attrition rates and potential causes

* Track department-wise workforce distribution

* Understand diversity metrics such as gender balance

* Analyze employee performance and tenure

* Empower HR stakeholders with interactive, self-service analytics
